# MyProject — Modern Next.js Starter

This repository is a small, opinionated Next.js app using the App Router and Tailwind CSS. I added a simple header, footer and a contact page to make the site feel more production-ready.

## What's included

- App Router pages in `app/` (home, about, service, contact, login)
- Reusable components in `components/` (ThemeToggle, Header, Footer)
- Tailwind CSS already configured (see `tailwind.config.js`)

## Run locally

Install deps and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## New pages added

- `/contact` — contact form and details

## Next steps (optional)

- Add backend handling for the contact form (API route or 3rd-party provider).
- Improve images with `next/image` for better performance.
- Add metadata and Open Graph tags for improved SEO.
